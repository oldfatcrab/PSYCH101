# <a name="1"></a>Lecture 01: Introduction, History, and Research Methods

## <a name="1a"></a>What is Psychology?

- 5 core courses of psychology (that the structure of this course):
    - Behavioral neuroscience
    - Developmental psychology
    - Cognitive psychology
    - Clinical psychology
    - Social psychology
- What psychology isn't?
    - Psychoanalysis: within clinical psychology, virtually no one is doing psychoanalysis anymore
    - Common Sense:
        - example: same people or opposite people attract
    - Torture of animals or people:
        - Some animals were sacrificed, but this is still consider ethical
- Psychology is hard to define, because people are hard to define
    - A way to think about psychology:
        - it has to do with what people think; it's about the **thoughts** that are in our heads
            - Historically, "thoughts" should not be part of psychology
        - our emotions, motivations, (or **feeling**) are not always the same as our thoughts, are not always captured by our thoughts
            - you can have reactions without thoughts that correspond with them
        - Psychology is also about **behavior** - how you act
        - They don't usually go together

## <a name="1b"></a>History of Psychology

### <a name="1b1"></a>The Three Beginnings of Psychology

- First psychologist: Freud
    - the **psychiatric** tradition in psychology
    - started psychoanalysis
        - nowadays represented more in medicine than in psychology
    - psychiatrists really have no training in psychology
    - he didn't write his first major work "The Interpretation of Dreams" until 1898
- **Testing tradition**
    - seen most heavily in the study of intelligence Testing
    - developed in England
    - one of the key players was Sir Francis Galton, a first cousin of Charles Darwin
    - heavy biological influence on much of the test tradition still somewhat represented particularly in the evolutionary side of psychology
    - narrowest of the three traditions
    - Galton started his work in the 1870s
- **Academic Approach** (Laboratory Psychology)
    - Wilhelm Wundt
        - set up the first psychology laboratory
        - Wundt is interesting partly for his failure
        - he wanted to have a clearly scientific approach
        - he believed that thoughts could be divided into mental atoms
    - 3 reactions to Wundt
        - William James
            - a student of Wundt's and a contemporary of Freud's
            - made a log of progress and in many ways made a very important contribution
            - brought psychology to North America
        - John B. Watson
            - one of the early proponents of behaviourism
        - Gestalt psychologists in Europe

### <a name="1b2"></a>The Psychiatric Tradition

- Major Theorists of Psychiatric Tradition
    - Freud
        - psychiatric tradition is dominated by Freud
        - had a very complex theory about the way the psyche worked
        - two **primary motives** that drive people: **sex and aggression**
        - much of what drives our behaviour is **unconscious**
        - huge inner mental life that we are unaware of which is very complex and very devious
        - (some are wacky, like the following)
        - Oedipus complex
            - Freud believed that this is what influenced much of adult development
            - was the central problem to the human psyche
            - as children boys want to have sex with their mothers, and in realizing that this is not possible, vicariously live this through their father's sex life with the mother
            - this did not help to explain how women developed
    - Carl Jung (Freud's student)
        - Jung was an incredibly brilliant man
        - more important for his literature in terms of its interpretation of the world - Steppenwolf
        - his theories are not taken very seriously by psychology
    - Carl Adler (Freud's student)
        - had totally different ideas from Freud
        - believed that people wanted to **be powerful** (not sex and aggression), wanted to be in **control**
        - in some ways you see echoes of Adler's thoughts in modern psychology with the concern for self-esteem
        - Ego Psychologists
            - followed in the Freudian tradition and have made an important impact on modern psychology
            - Erik Erickson - **model of Social Development**
            - Karen Horney and Henry Stack Sullivan - focused on the **importance of relationships** in developing the self-concept
- The major assumptions of the Psychiatric Tradition
    1. cannot rely on what people say or do to indicate what kind of problems they are experiencing because everything is thought to be unconscious
        - the emphasis is not on what people tell you, but on the interpretation of what is said
    2. emphasis on understanding each individual person comprehensively
        - the emphasis is on studying one person at a time and knowing all the details about that person
        - most of the research done in the psychiatric tradition has been through therapy over a number of years
        -  understanding the individual comprehensively as a dynamic whole
    3. the best approach is a clinical approach
        - more is learned by studying people who are sick, than through those who are healthy
        - tells you more about what is hidden beneath the psyche, what is really going on

### <a name="1b3"></a>The Testing Tradition

- The major Theorists of the Testing Tradition
    - Charles Darwin
    - Sir Francis Galton (Darwin's cousin)
        - had a naive idea of how to study what makes people fit and the most most likely to survive
        - wanted to figure out what makes someone a genius, what makes somebody superior
        - in the testing tradition there is an underlying element of elitism; aristocracy
        - connected his ideas with Darwin's theory of evolution
        - assumed that those who would be the smartest were also the ones who were most physically capable
        - first measure of intelligence was to do physical tests
        - very intelligent mathematician; came up many new statistical and mathematical techniques
    - Spearman (Galton's student)
        - along with Galton, developed many new important statistical techniques and ways of studying things
        - factor analysis: way of figuring out what goes together
    - Cattel & Eysenek
        - very famous in the Trait Tradition
        - from very different points of view came up with similar models on what it is that makes up a person
        - what are the **important personality dimensions**
            - Two major components to personally:
                1. Introversion vs Extroversion (if it is outgoing)
                2. Neuroticism (if get worried easily)
    - Binet
        - was the first to figure out how to actually **perform an intelligence test**
        - first intelligence test that was given covered topics one would learn in school
        - was basically trying to figure out what age level a child was at, instead of their grade level
        - very similar to what we now think of as school testing
- The major assumptions of the Testing Tradition
    1. Psychology is primarily a product of biology
        - emphasis on nature over nurture and evolution
        - if you want to know what people are about, the most important thing to understand is the evolutionary basis of behaviour
    2. There are only a few ways in which people differ
        - there are only a small number of traits which can explain the important differences between people
    3. People's traits can be understood through simple tests
        - almost all the research is done with questionnairs and paper and pencil tests

### <a name="1b4"></a>The Academic Tradition

- This is like 75-80% of the course
- The major theorists of the Academic Tradition
    - Wilhelm Wundt
        - **psychological atomism**
        - would have people come in and tell him about a thought that they had had; **introspect**
        - thought that he would get a nice periodic table of psychological atoms, and instead he got thousands, which didn't make any sense, and were not organized in any sort of pattern
        - several other approaches followed
    - William James
        - **pragmatism**
        - believed Wundt was wrong for not studying what people really cared about
        - pragmatic approach 0 to study things that are meaningful to people
        - still important to North American psychology
        - "what does it matter?" is an important question
    - Watson & Skinner
        - took the approach of Behaviourism which dominated for about 40 years in North American psychology
        - believed that Wundt was not scientific enough; trying to study "thought" which cannot be observed
        - behaviourists felt that "thought" should not be studied
        - rationale was that if it is to be studied scientifically, it **must be observable**, i.e. behaviour
        - defined psychology as the scientific study of behaviour
        - made progress in a number of different domains
    - Kurt Lewin
        - Gestalt psychology
        - argued that Wundt made a wrong assumption, that the whole does not equal the sum of the parts
        - this was a powerful perspective
        - many times the **parts don't add up to the wholes** that we see and come to know and understand
- The Major Assumptions of the Academic Tradition
    1. Psychology is best understood when the causes are understood
        - we need to understand what causes a behaviour
        - the "why" is more important than the "how" or the "when"
        - if you understand the "why", you will know the "how" and the "when"
    2. People's thoughts and actions can be understood
        - thoughts and actions are not outside of the individual, are not irrelevant
        - by observing people, we can understand them
    3. Systematic study produces the fullest understanding
        - set up labs and experiments
            - Wundt's Lab - studies questions like "how long does one take to press a button"
            - William James' Lab

### <a name="1b5"></a>Three New Beginnings of Psychology

- in the 1960s and 70s, each of these traditions had a significant rebirth (new biginning)
- The Psychiatric Tradition
    - Humanistic Approach - The Third Wave
        - Carl Rogers
            - what Rogers tried to do in his therapy was very different from the Psychoanalytic Tradition
            - he **reflected back** to the individual what they were feeling
            - belief that people are basically good, and if you can let them get in touch with themselves, let them understand themselves, they will get better
            - they need to get in touch with this good inner part of who they are
- The Trait Tradition
    - developed and expanded from only two personality traits, Neuroticism and Extroversion, to big five important personality traits
        - **The Big Five Model of Personality** (OCEAN)
            1. Openness = intelligence
                - open to new experiences
                - more flexible in their thinking
                - more intelligent and have more education
            2. Conscientiousness
                - people who really stick to their goals
                - work hard and get things done
            3. _Extroversion_
            4. Agreeableness
                - how positive or negative of a person are you
            5. _Neuroticism_
- The Academic Tradition
    - The Cognitive Revolution
        - in the 60s and 70s there was huge growth and changes in the field from Behaviourism to Cognitive psychology
        - study of thought is one of the primary and important things about people
        - Albert Bandura - Observational Learning
        - it became clear that with Behaviourism there was much that could **not** be explained
        - we can learn by observing people rather than just being reinforced
        - cognitive revolution changed the face of psychology

## <a name="1c"></a>Research Methodology

### <a name="1c1"></a>Basic Philosophy of Science

- there are actually some big questions behind research methodology
- focus on the Academic Tradition
- keep in mind that the other traditions may not feel the same way
- our ideas can often be wrong
- we set out to demonstrate that our ideas are wrong
    - only draw firm conclusions when we have shown that the idea is wrong
- we accept an idea when we can't prove that it is wrong
    - this does not mean that someone else won't prove that the idea is wrong
    - good to have a healthy skepticism
- we might well prove them wrong later
- a number of things influence these ideas
    - what is accepted is often what is popular
    - what is accepted is shaped by political forces and social influences

### <a name="1c2"></a>Ways of Doing Research

- Tension between **Discovery** and **Explanation**
    - When something is discovered and is brand new, does it really mean anything?
    - some sciences are mostly about explanation; how things work, how things unfold
    - psychology is in the middle of these two extremes; always new discoveries, but explanations are crucial
    - different traditions have a different emphasis on discovery and explanation, and they do different types of research because of this
    - Psychiatric tradition uses mostly **case studies** in it's research
        - One of Freuds famous case studies: Anna O.
            - Freud was Anna's therapist for many years
            - developed an unusual illness after a couple years of caring for her sick father
            - was blind even though there was nothing physically wrong with her
            - also had Glove Paralysis - paralysis of the hand
            - Freud believed that Anna was having fantasies about sex with her father, and that this was the cause of her problems
            - many modern psychologists feel that Anna was being sexually abused by her father
            - Freud thought that the tales of sexual abuse were all part of her fantasy
- Naturalistic Observation
    - similar to a case study but usually broader
    - observe, watch and see what happens
    - Jane Goodall's research with chimps
    - not very often done with people
- Survey Research
    - get a sample of populations, ask them questions, and see them how to answer it
    - goal is often to find out what the whole population is like, from surveying a sample portion of that population
    - problem of representativeness
        - e.g. political polling
    - establishes generality
    - sets up correlations between variables
    - when one thing happens, another thing tends to happen
    - Example of **Correlation** established by Survey Research
        - correlation between children watching violent television, and being violent
        - can randomly sample children throughout all of Canada to find out how much violent television they watch
        - then find out how often they use violent behaviour
        - what you find is a nice reliable correlation between children watching violence, and children acting the violence out
    - Correlation doesn't mean causation
        - just because children who watch too much violent television tend to be violent, doesn't necessarily mean that the television caused the violent behaviour
- Experiments
    - usually about establishing **causation**
    - Example of Correlation established by Survey Research
        - one possibility is that the violent television causes the violent behaviour, but is that really what is going on? maybe it is violent kids like to watch violent television
        - whenever you have a correlation, you have to think about in which direction does it go; does A cause B, or does B cause A, or other reason causes A and B, like following
        - perhaps the child is being abused by the parent(s), or is hyperactive
        - maybe it is education
        - there is always the possibility of having many variables when you have a correlation
        - causation establishes which one it is, which pattern is right

### <a name="1c3"></a>Research Methods - Surveys & Establishing Representatives

- Representative group of people
    - you want the people filling out the survey to correspond to the larger group that you want to generalize, to represent, so we do **Random Sampling** (different from [Random Assignment]((#1c4RandomAssignment))):
        - have a large group of people and take a small subset to do the survey on
- Need to ask unbiased questions
    - Anchoring Effects
        - give people something that you know is wrong, but it still influences the way they interpret the question, and then try to explain it
        - Is the Mississippi river longer or shorter than 500 miles? How long is it?
        - will actually give a short estimate because they are still influenced by the 500, even though everybody knows it's wrong
        - get 'anchored' by the other idea
    - Framing Effects
    - these are ways of asking questions in which the first part of the question, ends up influencing how the question will be answered
- don't want to have anchoring or framing effects because you will not get an accurate representation of the population
- surveys do a good job of establishing correlation among variables

### <a name="1c4"></a>Correlation Is Not Causation: How Do You Establish Causation?

- Correlation
    - when one variable changes, the other variable changes as well
- Time Order
    - need to know which comes first
    - Did the children watch the violent television and then become aggressive later on, or were they aggressive before viewing violence on television?
    - this is why many like to do longitudinal research
- Elimination of all other possible causes
    - Examples
        - Were the parents more aggressive?
        - Did they come from poor families?
        - Were the children who were more aggressive likely to be hyperactive?
    - Experiments do this through <a name="1c4RandomAssignment"></a>**random assignment**
        - randomly assign people to various conditions
        - take a small group in an experiment, and randomly have one half do one assignment, and the other half do another
    - Independent variable
        - what we think is going to be the cause
        - Experimental group - watches television
            - Control group - doesn't watch television
    - Dependent variable
        - behaviour that you are concerned with in the end; the effect
        - have children play together to see if they will fight
        - we want the dependent variable to be:
            - **valid** - measures what is is supposed to measure
            - **reliable** - get the same outcome every time
            - example:
                - reliable, but not valid: ![reliable](imgs/1c3_reliable.jpg)
                - valid, but not reliable: ![valid](imgs/1c3_valid.jpg)
- How experiments try to establish causation
    - time order is built in independent variable leads to the dependent variable
    - eliminating other causes
    - randomly assigned

# <a name="2"></a>Lecture 02: Behavioural Neuroscience I

## <a name="2a"></a>The Nervous System and the Brain - The Big Picture

- Neuron
    - the basic cells that make up the' nervous system
- Peripheral Nervous System
    - all the other nerves that run through the body which are not the brain or the spinal cord
- The Central Nervous System and the Brain
    - it is probably one of the frontiers that we understand the least of in psychology
- The Endocrine System
    - hormones
    - the different chemicals that float through he blood and also influence us
- Putting it all together - The Example of Hunger
    - not completely separate systems, all work together and influence eachother
    - we can look at hunger as an "ample of höw all these systems work together

## <a name="2b"></a>Neuron

### <a name="2b1"></a>The Neuron

- A neuron looks like this: ![neuron](imgs/2b1_neuron.jpg)]
    - Myelin Sheath:
        - globular part of the neuron which are **not found in the neurons of the brain**
        - lets the electric current bounce from node to node, so that the impulse can travel quickly
        - neurons which are part of the Peripheral System and part of the spinal cord, actually work **faster than in the brain**
    - Dendrites
        - are found at the back end of the neuron (Terminal Branches of axon is the front end of a neuron)
    - Cell Body
        - the cell's life-support centre
- How do you take a piece of tissue, like a cell or a neuron, and have it conduct electricity?
    - Study of Sea Slugs
- How impulses travel down the Neuron: ![travel](imgs/2b1_travel.jpg)
    - movement of ions in and out of the cell membrane is what creates the electricity and causes it to flow down the neuron (toward axon terminals)
- Synapse: ![synapse](imgs/2b1_synapse.jpg)
    - to simplify the process:
        - the action potential breaks down the vesicle containing neurotransmitters in axon terminal
        - then the neurotransmitters go through the synaptic gap
        - and it changes the ions in the next neuron
        - after it goes through, the neuron has to reuptake, in order for the transmitter can be used again, in a really short period of time
    - but it is not that simple because:
        - each neuron is connected from and to multiple other neurons
        - it's a very complex combination of a whole bunch of synapses coming together at once to determine whether the next one fires
        - i.e. some makes the next neuron firing, some makes the next neuron stop firing

### <a name="2b2"></a>Neurotransmitters

- Dopamine
    - very common especially in the brain
    - Parkinson's Disease
        - part of the cause is a deficiency of dopamine
        - marked by tremors
        - very important in the coordination of movement
    - also important in attention and emotion
    - Schizophrenia
        - marked by an excess of dopamine in various parts of the brain
- Serotonin
    - involved in mood, hunger, sleep and arousal
    - it affects things widely in the brain
    - a deficiency of serotonin is a cause for insomnia
    - deficiencies are also associated with depression
- Norepinephrine
    - more related to alertness and arousal
    - also associated with depression
- Acetylcholine
    - the most common neurotransmitter
    - involved in muscle movement
    - Alzheimer's Disease
        - the neurons that work through acetylcholine get ruined with Alzheimer's
    - also involved in learning and memory
- Endorphines
    - involved in pain regulation
    - when injured, the body naturally releases these endorphines which allow you to handle a lot more pain
    - heroine and morphine mimic this neurotransmitter

### <a name="2b3"></a>How Drugs Affect Neurotransmitters

- Here is a picture showing the synapse: ![neurotransmitters](imgs/2b3_neurotransmitters.jpg)
    - at the synapse gap, neurotransmitters come across have complex shapes
    - on the other side of dendrites, receptor sites with complex shape that neurotransmitters fitting in
    - when it fits in, it changes the receiving cell membrane, and starts/stops the impulse depends on the type of neurotransmitter
- Drugs mimics the shape of neurotransmitter, 2 ways for drugs to work:
    1. **Agonist**: by acting just like the neurotransmitter, and in effect making It think that there is more of it; good if there is a deficiency of neurotransmitters
    2. **Antagonist**: others act like blockers and keep the neurotransmitter from having as much of an effect; good if there is too much of a neurotransmitter

## <a name="2c"></a>Divisions of the Nervous System

- Nervous System
    - Peripheral
        - Autonomic (controls self-regulated action of internal organs and glands)
            - Sysmathetic (arousing): gets you ready for fight or flight
            - Parasympathetic (calming): lets you build up all your energy
        - Somatic (controls voluntary movements of skeletal muscles)
    - Central (brain and spinal cord)

### <a name="2c1"></a>The Peripheral Nervous System

- Somatic Nervous System
    - controls voluntary muscles and their movement
- Autonomic Nervous System
    - controls the glands
    - controls the muscles related to our organs
    - although possible to override by conscious thought, for the most part these reactions occur spontaneously

### <a name="2c2"></a>The Central Nervous System

![central](imgs/2c2_central.jpg)
- The Spinal Cord
    - carries information from the Peripheral Nervous system up to the brain
    - does some 'thinking', in that it controls some repsonses
    - these responses are typically referred to as reflexes
    - type of neurons that cannot only transmit things, but can route things different ways; almost makes some primitive types of decisions
- The Brain
    - does almost all the processing other than the simple reflexes
- Three areas of the brain you need to know about
![brain](imgs/2c2_brain.jpg)
    1. Brainstem
        - it is injury to the brainstem that usually kills
        - controls all the vital functions
        - very crucial even though it is only a small part of the brain
    2. Lymbic system
        - controls motivation and emotion
        - very important for memory
    3. Cerebral Cortex
        - separates us from animals

### <a name="2c3"></a>How the Spinal Cord Controls Reflexes

A Simple Reflex

### <a name="2c4"></a>The Brain

The Four Parts of the Brain Stem
Medulla
absolutely critical in keeping us alive
controls the heartbeat and breathing
Reticular formation
controls attention, alertness, and reactivity
can be thought of as the accelerator of the brain
basic function that regulates the overall amount Of brain
activity
Thalamus
sensory switching point
crucial for vision and other senses
beginning processes Of our senses come about
Cerebellum
crucial for movement and coordination of movement
crucial for balance
The Lymbic System
Pituitary gland
important in the production of many necessary hormones
Hypothalamus
crucial for hunger
controls the hormones Of the Pituitary gland
some influence on other emotions as well, particulary pleasure
Amygdala
important for a number of things, including anger
Hippocampus
crucial for memory and for laying down the functions of memory
damage can cause severe types Of memory disorders
The Cerebral Cortex - Basic Divisions
• involved in language and spacial recognition
• involved in hearing, memory and mood
• important in reasoning and thinking
involved in the complex processing Of information
The Cerebral Cortex Functional Divisions - Movement and Sense of Touch
the brain has no actual sensors for pain
there is a lot of specificity with the sensory and motor cortex
seizures occur when there is too much electncal activity in the motor cortex
motor cortex sends off charges to make movement throughout the body
in the case of a stroke, the motor cortex is damaged, and whatever is damaged is what will be paralyzed
often the stroke is only on one side of the brain, causing only one side of the body to be paralyzed
some people cannot move a part of their body, but can feel it
other people can move a part of their body, but cannot feel it as a result of damage in the Sensory cortex, which
did not affect the corresponding part of the Motor cortex
The Cerebral Cortex Functional Divisions - Hearing and Visions
• initially the sensory information comes in through the eyes, but it is processed by the Visual cortex at the back
Of the brain
. damage to this area can cause deafness with no possibility of correction
The Cerebral Cortex Functional Divisions - Left and Right Sides of the Brain
. thick area between the two brains for exchanging information
Epileptic Study
in the 1950s there was not much that they could do
to help epileptics with their seizures
in order to stop the seizures they severed the corpus
callosum; they cut the two sides of the brain apart
helps to reduce the number of seizures dramatically
because the electrical impulses do not spread to the
other side
this led to a new understanding of the brain
what was discovered was that the two sides of the brain
actually perfrom different functions
left side in particular is more verbal; able to produce
language in most people
right side is better at visual processing and coordinating;
can understand simple language
some left-handed people have a brain structured like a
right-hander, others have it reversed
Mike Gazanaga Study
helps to explain the 'executive' function of the left brain,
the ability to explain and interpret what is going on
brain is able to do this even when it is wrong
right brain can process visual stimuli, and can process
commands
when he would flash "Get up" to the right side of the brain,
a number of people would get up
their left brain was unaware of why they were getting up
because it has no access to that information
• everyone of them could instantaneously come up with an
explanation as to why they stood up
• left side of the brain is very good at rationalizing your own
behaviour
• Would the right side of the brain be better at picking up what
emotion is being shown on a face?

## <a name="2e"></a>Putting It All Together - The Case of Hunger

When we don't eat for a while, what makes us feel hungry?
• stomach contractions carry hunger signal through the
peripheral nervous system to the hypothalamus
blood sugar levels as interpreted and controlled by the
liver and pancreas send message to the hypothalamus
• lateral hypothalamus is stimulated and releases the
hormone orexin which heightens hunger
When we eat, what makes us no longer feel hungry?
• stomach expands and this message is transmitted to the
hypothalamus
• blood sugar levels as interpreted and controlled by the
liver and pancreas send message of higher levels to the
hypothalamus
• insulin is also released
• ventromedial hypothalamus is stimulated and which leads
to the feeling of satiation and helps stop the eating
Damage to the Hypothalamus
• if there is a lesion to the lateral hypothalamus then rats
basically starve themselves to death and virtually eat
nothing
• also seem lethargic and depressed
• if the ventromedial hypothalamus is damaged, then
rats basically will never stop eating and they get
very fat

## <a name="2f"></a>Overarching Principles

Structures of the brain and the various systems work together in coordinated,
overlapping, and redundant systems
Corpus callosum:
Amygdala:
in the lymbic
system linke
to emotion
Hippocampus:
a structure In
the lymbic
system linked
to memory
Corpus callosum: —
axon fibers connecting
two cerebral hemispheres
Thalamus:
relays messages between
lower brain centers and
cerebral cortex
controls maintenance
functions such as eating,
he ps govern endocrine
system; linked to emotion
and reward
Pituitary:
master endocrine gland—
Reticular formation:
helps control arousal
Medulla:
controls heartbeat and
breathing
Spinal cord:
11thway for neural fibers
veling to and from
brain; controls simple
reflexes
Cerebellum:
coordinates voluntary
movement and balance
ultimate control and
information-processi
Despite all this specificity and complexity the brain has quite a bit of plasticity
• if an area is damaged other areas can take over
