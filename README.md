# <a name="1"></a>Lecture 01: Introduction, History, and Research Methods
## <a name="1a"></a>What is Psychology?
- 5 core courses of psychology (that the structure of this course):
    - Behavioral neuroscience
    - Developmental psychology
    - Cognitive psychology
    - Clinical psychology
    - Social psychology
- What psychology isn't?
    - Psychoanalysis: within clinical psychology, virtually no one is doing psychoanalysis anymore
    - Common Sense:
        - example: same people or opposite people attract
    - Torture of animals:
        - Some animals were sacrificed, but this is ethical
- Psychology is hard to define, because people are hard to define
    - A way to think about psychology:
        - it has to do with what people think; it's about the **thoughts** that are in our heads
            - Historically, "thoughts" should not be part of psychology
        - our **emotions**, (or feeling) are not always the same as our thoughts, are not always captured by our thoughts
            - you can have reactions without thoughts that correspond with them
        - Psychology is also about **behavior** - how you act
        - They don't usually go together

## <a name="1b"></a>History of Psychology
### <a name="1b1"></a>The Three Beginnings of Psychology
- First psychologist: Freud
    - the psychiatric tradition in psychology
    - started psychoanalysis
        - nowadays represented more in medicine than in psychology
    - psychiatrists really have no training in psychology
    - he didn't write his first major work "The Interpretation of Dreams" until 1898
- Testing tradition
    - seen most heavily in the study of intelligence Testing
    - developed in England
    - one of the key players was Sir Francis Galton, a first cousin of Charles Darwin
    - heavy biological influence on much of the test tradition still somewhat represented particularly in the evolutionary side of psychology
    - narrowest of the three traditions
    Galton started his work in the 1870s
- Academic Approach (Laboratory Psychology)
    - Wilhelm Wundt
        - set up the first psychology laboratory
        - Wundt is interesting partly for his failure
        - he wanted to have a clearly scientific approach
        - he believed that thoughts could be divided into mental atoms
    - 3 reactions to Wundt
        - William James
            - a student of Wundt's and a contemporary of Freud's
            - made a log of progress and in many ways made a very important contribution
            - brought psychology to North America
        - John B. Watson
            - one of the early proponents of behaviourism
        - Gestalt psychologists in Europe

### <a name="1b2"></a>The Psychiatric Tradition
- Major Theorists of tradition
    - Freud
        - tradition is dominated by Freud
        - had a very complex theory about the way the psyche worked
        - two primary motives that drive people: sex and aggression
        - much of what drives our behaviour is unconscious
        - huge inner mental life that we are unaware of which is very complex and very devious
        - (some are wacky)
        - Oedipus complex
            - Freud believed that this is what influenced much of adult development
            - was the central problem to the human psyche
            - as children boys want to have sex with their mothers, and in realizing that this is not possible, vicariously live this through their father's sex life with the mother
            - this did not help to explain how women developed
    - Carl Jung (Freud's student)
        - Jung was an incredibly brilliant man
        - more important for his literature in terms of its interpretation of the world - Steppenwolf
        - his theories are not taken very seriously by psychology
    - Carl Adler (Freud's student)
        - had totally different ideas from Freud
        - believed that people wanted to be powerful, wanted to be in control
        - in some ways you see echoes of Adler's thoughts in modern psychology with the concern for self-esteem
        - Ego Psychologists
            - followed in the Freudian tradition and have made an important impact on modern psychology
            - Erik Erickson - model of Social Development
            - Karen Horney and Henry Stack Sullivan - focused on the importance of relationships in developing the self-concept
- The major assumptions of the Psychiatric Tradition
    - cannot rely on what people say or do to indicate what kind of problems they are experiencing because everything is thought to be unconscious
        - the emphasis is not on what people tell you, but on the interpretation of what is said
    - emphasis on understanding each individual person comprehensively
        - the emphasis is on studying one person at a time and knwoing all the details about that person
        - most of the research done in the psychiatric tradition has been through therapy over a number of years
        -  understanding the individual comprehensively as a dynamic whole
    - the best approach is a clinical approach
        - more is learned by studying people who are sick, than through those who are healthy
        - tells you more about what is hidden beneath the psych, what is really going on

### <a name="1b3"></a>The Testing Tradition
- The major Theorists of the Testing Tradition
    - Charles Darwin
    - Sir Francis Galton (Darwin's cousin)
        - had a naive idea of how to study what makes people fit and the most most likely to survive
         - wanted to figure out what makes someone a genius, what makes somebody superior
         - in the testing tradition there is an underlying element of elitism; aristocracy
         - connected his ideas with Darwin's theory of evolution
         - assumed that those who would be the smartest were also the ones who were most physically capable
         - first measure of intelligence was to do physical tests
         - very intelligent mathematician; came up many new statistical and mathematical techniques
    - Spearman (Galton's student)
        - along with Galton, developed many new important statistical techniques and ways of studying things
        - factor analysis: way of figuring out what goes together
    - Cattel & Eysenek
        - very famous in the Trait Tradition
        - from very different points of view came up with similar models on what it is that makes up a person
        - what are the important personality dimensions
            - Two major components to personally:
                1. Introversion vs Extroversion
                2. Neuroticism
    - Binet
        - was the first to figure out how to actually perform an intelligence test
        - first intelligence test that was given covered topics one would learn in school
        - was basically trying to figure out what age level a child was at, instead of their grade level
        - very similar to what we now think of as school testing
- The major assumptions of the Testing Tradition
    1. Psychology is primarily a product of biology
        - emphasis on nature over nurture and evolution
        - if you want to know what people are about, the most important thing to understand is the evolutionary basis of behaviour
    2. There are only a few ways in which people differ
       - there are only a small number of traits which can explain the important differences between people
    3. People's traits can be understood through simple tests
       - almost all the research is done with questionnairs and paper and pencil tests

### <a name="1b4"></a>The Academic Tradition
- This is like 75-80% of the course
- The major theorists of the Academic Tradition
    - Wilhelm Wundt
        - psychological atomism
        - would have people come in and tell him about a thought that they had had; introspect
        - thought that he would get a nice periodic table of psychological atoms, and instead he got thousands, which didn't make any sense, and were not organized in any sort of pattern
        - several other approaches followed
    - William James
        - pragmatism
        - believed Wundt was wrong for not studying what people really cared about
        - pragmatic approach 0 to study things that are meaningful to people
        - still important to North American psychology
        - "what does it matter?" is an important question
    - Watson & Skinner
        - took the approch of Behaviourism which dominated for about 40 years in North American psychology
        - believed that Wundt was not scienctific enough; trying to study "thought" which cannot be observed
        - behaviourists felt that "thought" should not be studied
        - rationale was that if it is to be sutdied scientifically, it must be observable, i.e. behaviour
        - defined psychology as the scientific study of behaviour
        - made progress in a number of different domains
    - Kurt Lewin
        - Gestalt psychology
        - argued that Wundt made a wrong assumption, that the whole does not equal the sum of the parts
        - this was a powerful perspective
        - many times the parts don't add up to the wholes that we see and come to know and understand
- The Major Assumptions of the Academic Tradition
    1. Psychology is best understood when the causes are understood
        - we need to understand what causes a behaviour
        - the "why" is more important than the "how" or the "when"
        - if you understand the "why", you will know the "how" and the "when"
    2. People's thoughts and actions can be understood
        - thoughts and actions are not outside of the individual, are not irrelevant
        - by observing people, we can understand them
    3. Systematic study produces the fullest understanding
        - set up labs and experiments
            - Wundt's Lab - studies questions like "how long does one take to press a button"
            - William James' Lab -

### <a name="1b5"></a>Three New Beginnings of Psychology

- in the 1960s and 70s, each of these traditions had a significant rebirth
- The Psychiatric Tradition
    - Humanistic Approach - The Third Wave
        - Carl Rogers
            - what Rogers tried to do in his therapy was very different from the Psychoanalytic Tradition
            - he reflected back to the individual what they were feeling
            - belief that people are basically good, and if you can let them get in touch with themselves, let them understand themselves, they will get better
            - they need to get in touch with this good inner part of who they are
- The Trait Tradition
    - developed and expanded from only two personality traits, Neuroticism and Extroversion, to five important personality traits
        - The Big Five Model of Personality (OCEAN)
            1. Openness = intelligence
                - open to new experiences
                - more flexible in their thinking
                - more intelligent and have more education
            2. Conscientiousness
                - people who really stick to their goals
                - work hard and get things done
            3. Extroversion
            4. Agreeableness
                - how positive or negative of a person are you
            5. Neuroticism
- The Academic Tradition
    - The Cognitive Revolution
        - in the 60s and 70s there was huge growth and changes in the field from Behaviourism to Cognitive psychology
        - study of thought is one of the primary and important things about people
        - Albert Bandura Observational Learning
        - it became clear that with Behaviourism there was much that could not be explained
        - we can learn by observing people rather than just being reinforced
        - cognitive revolution changed the face of psychology

## <a name="1c"></a>Research Methodology
### <a name="1c1"></a>Basic Philosophy of Science
- there are actually some big questions behind research methodology
- focus on the Academic Tradition
- keep in mind that the other traditions may not feel the same way
- our ideas can often be wrong
- we set out to demonstrate that our ideas are wrong
    - only draw firm conclusions when we have shown that the idea is wrong
- we accept an idea when we can't prove that it is wrong
    - this does not mean that someone else won't prove that the idea is wrong
    - good to have a healthy skepticism
- we might well prove them wrong later
- a number of things influence these ideas
    - what is accepted is often what is popular
    - what is accepted is shaped by political forces and social influences

### <a name="1c2"></a>Ways of Doing Research
- Tension between **Discovery** and **Explanation**
    - When something is discovered and is brand new, does it really mean anything?
    - some sciences are mostly about explanation; how things work, how things unfold
    - psychology is in the middle of these two extremes; always new discoveries, but explanations are crucial
    - different traditions have a different emphasis on discovery and explanation, and they do different types of research because of this
    - Psychiatric tradition uses mostly **case studies** in it's research
        - One of Freuds famous case studies: Anna O.
            - Freud was Anna's therapist for many years
            - developed an unusual illness after a couple years of caring for her sick father
            - was blind even though there was nothing physically wrong with her
            - also had Glove Paralysis - paralysis of the hand
            - Freud believed that Anna was having fantasies about sex with her father, and that this was the cause of her problems
            - many modern psychologists feel that Anna was being sexually abused by her father
            - Freud thought that the tales of sexual abuse were all part of her fantasy
- Naturalistic Observation
    - similar to a case study but usually broader
    - observe, watch and see what happens
    - Jane Goodall's research with chimps
    - not very often done with people
- Survey Research
    - get a sample of populations, ask them questions, and see them how to answer it
    - goal is often to find out what the whole population is like, from surveying a sample portion of that population
    - problem of representativeness
        - e.g. political polling
    - establishes generality
    - sets up correlations between variables
    - when one thing happens, another thing tends to happen
    - Example of **Correlation** established by Survey Research
        - correlation between children watching violent television, and being violent
        - can randomly sample children throughout all of Canada to find out how much violent television they watch
        - then find out how often they use violent behaviour
        - what you find is a nice reliable correlation between children watching violence, and children acting the violence out
    - Correlation doesn't mean causation
        - just because children who watch too much violent television tend to be violent, doesn't necessarily mean that the television caused the violent behaviour
- Experiments
    - usually about establishing **causation**
    - Example of Correlation established by Survey Research
        - one possibility is that the violent television causes the violent behaviour, but is that really what is going on? maybe it is violent kids like to watch violent television
        - whenever you have a correlation, you have to think about in which direction does it go; does A cause B, or does B cause A, or other reason causes A and B, like following
        - perhaps the child is being abused by the parent(s), or is hyperactive
        - maybe it is education
        - there is always the possibility of having many variables when you have a correlation
        - causation establishes which one it is, which pattern is right

### <a name="1c3"></a>Research Methods - Surveys & Establishing Representatives
Representative group of people
• you want the people filling out the survey to correspond
to the larger group that you want to generalize, to
represent
Random Sampling
have a large group of people and take a small
subset to do the survey on
Need to ask unbiased questions
• Anchoring Effects
Framing Effects
these are ways of asking questions in which the first
part of the question, ends up influencing how the
question will be answered
Need to ask unbiased questions
Anchoring Effects
give people something that you know is wrong, but it
still influences the way they interpret the question,
and then try to explain it
Is the Mississippi river longer or shorter than 500
miles? How long is it?
• will actually give a short estimate because they are
still influenced by the 500, even though everybody
knows it's wrong
get 'anchored' by the other idea
don't want to have anchoring or framing effects
because you will not get an accurate representation
of the population
surveys do a good job of establishing correlation
among variables
### <a name="1c4"></a>Correlation Is Not Causation: How Do You Establish Causation?
Correlation
• when one variable changes, the other variable changes as well
Time Order
• need to know which comes first
• Did the children watch the violent television and
then become aggressive later on, or were they
aggressive before viewing violence on television?
this is why many like to do longitudinal research
Elimination of all other possible causes
• Examples
Were the parents more aggressive?
• Did they come from poor families?
Were the children who were more aggressive
likely to be hyperactive?
Experiments do this through random assignment
randomly assign people to various conditions
take a small group in an experiment, and randomly
have one half do one assignment, and the other
half do another
How experiments try to establish causation
• Independent variable
what we think is going to be the cause
• Experimental group - watches television
Control group - doesn't watch television
Dependent variable
behaviour that you are concerned with in the
end; the effect
• have children play together to see if they will
fight
• we want the dependent variable to be:
valid - measures what is is supposed to measure
reliable - get the same outcome every time
How experiments try to establish causation
• time order is built in
independent variable leads to the dependent
variable
eliminating other causes
randomly assigned
