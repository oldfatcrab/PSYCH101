# <a name="1"></a>Lecture 01: Introduction, History, and Research Methods

## <a name="1a"></a>What is Psychology?

- 5 core courses of psychology (that the structure of this course):
    - Behavioral neuroscience
    - Developmental psychology
    - Cognitive psychology
    - Clinical psychology
    - Social psychology

- What psychology isn't?
    - Psychoanalysis: within clinical psychology, virtually no one is doing psychoanalysis anymore
    - Common Sense:
        - example: same people or opposite people attract
    - Torture of animals or people:
        - Some animals were sacrificed, but this is still consider ethical
- Psychology is hard to define, because people are hard to define
    - A way to think about psychology:
        - it has to do with what people think; it's about the **thoughts** that are in our heads
            - Historically, "thoughts" should not be part of psychology
        - our emotions, motivations, (or **feeling**) are not always the same as our thoughts, are not always captured by our thoughts
            - you can have reactions without thoughts that correspond with them
        - Psychology is also about **behavior** - how you act
        - They don't usually go together

## <a name="1b"></a>History of Psychology

### <a name="1b1"></a>The Three Beginnings of Psychology

- First psychologist: Freud
    - the **psychiatric** tradition in psychology
    - started psychoanalysis
        - nowadays represented more in medicine than in psychology
    - psychiatrists really have no training in psychology
    - he didn't write his first major work "The Interpretation of Dreams" until 1898
- **Testing tradition**
    - seen most heavily in the study of intelligence Testing
    - developed in England
    - one of the key players was Sir Francis Galton, a first cousin of Charles Darwin
    - heavy biological influence on much of the test tradition still somewhat represented particularly in the evolutionary side of psychology
    - narrowest of the three traditions
    - Galton started his work in the 1870s

- **Academic Approach** (Laboratory Psychology)
    - Wilhelm Wundt
        - set up the first psychology laboratory
        - Wundt is interesting partly for his failure
        - he wanted to have a clearly scientific approach
        - he believed that thoughts could be divided into mental atoms
    - 3 reactions to Wundt
        - William James
            - a student of Wundt's and a contemporary of Freud's
            - made a log of progress and in many ways made a very important contribution
            - brought psychology to North America
        - John B. Watson
            - one of the early proponents of behaviourism
        - Gestalt psychologists in Europe

### <a name="1b2"></a>The Psychiatric Tradition

- Major Theorists of Psychiatric Tradition
    - Freud
        - psychiatric tradition is dominated by Freud
        - had a very complex theory about the way the psyche worked
        - two **primary motives** that drive people: **sex and aggression**
        - much of what drives our behaviour is **unconscious**
        - huge inner mental life that we are unaware of which is very complex and very devious
        - (some are wacky, like the following)
        - Oedipus complex
            - Freud believed that this is what influenced much of adult development
            - was the central problem to the human psyche
            - as children boys want to have sex with their mothers, and in realizing that this is not possible, vicariously live this through their father's sex life with the mother
            - this did not help to explain how women developed
    - Carl Jung (Freud's student)
        - Jung was an incredibly brilliant man
        - more important for his literature in terms of its interpretation of the world - Steppenwolf
        - his theories are not taken very seriously by psychology
    - Carl Adler (Freud's student)
        - had totally different ideas from Freud
        - believed that people wanted to **be powerful** (not sex and aggression), wanted to be in **control**
        - in some ways you see echoes of Adler's thoughts in modern psychology with the concern for self-esteem
        - Ego Psychologists
            - followed in the Freudian tradition and have made an important impact on modern psychology
            - Erik Erickson - **model of Social Development**
            - Karen Horney and Henry Stack Sullivan - focused on the **importance of relationships** in developing the self-concept

- The major assumptions of the Psychiatric Tradition
    1. cannot rely on what people say or do to indicate what kind of problems they are experiencing because everything is thought to be unconscious
        - the emphasis is not on what people tell you, but on the interpretation of what is said
    2. emphasis on understanding each individual person comprehensively
        - the emphasis is on studying one person at a time and knowing all the details about that person
        - most of the research done in the psychiatric tradition has been through therapy over a number of years
        -  understanding the individual comprehensively as a dynamic whole
    3. the best approach is a clinical approach
        - more is learned by studying people who are sick, than through those who are healthy
        - tells you more about what is hidden beneath the psyche, what is really going on

### <a name="1b3"></a>The Testing Tradition

- The major Theorists of the Testing Tradition
    - Charles Darwin
    - Sir Francis Galton (Darwin's cousin)
        - had a naive idea of how to study what makes people fit and the most likely to survive
        - wanted to figure out what makes someone a genius, what makes somebody superior
        - in the testing tradition there is an underlying element of elitism; aristocracy
        - connected his ideas with Darwin's theory of evolution
        - assumed that those who would be the smartest were also the ones who were most physically capable
        - first measure of intelligence was to do physical tests
        - very intelligent mathematician; came up many new statistical and mathematical techniques
    - Spearman (Galton's student)
        - along with Galton, developed many new important statistical techniques and ways of studying things
        - factor analysis: way of figuring out what goes together
    - Cattel & Eysenek
        - very famous in the Trait Tradition
        - from very different points of view came up with similar models on what it is that makes up a person
        - what are the **important personality dimensions**
            - Two major components to personally:
                1. Introversion vs Extroversion (if it is outgoing)
                2. Neuroticism (if get worried easily)
    - Binet
        - was the first to figure out how to actually **perform an intelligence test**
        - first intelligence test that was given covered topics one would learn in school
        - was basically trying to figure out what age level a child was at, instead of their grade level
        - very similar to what we now think of as school testing

- The major assumptions of the Testing Tradition
    1. Psychology is primarily a product of biology
        - emphasis on nature over nurture and evolution
        - if you want to know what people are about, the most important thing to understand is the evolutionary basis of behaviour
    2. There are only a few ways in which people differ
        - there are only a small number of traits which can explain the important differences between people
    3. People's traits can be understood through simple tests
        - almost all the research is done with questionnairs and paper and pencil tests

### <a name="1b4"></a>The Academic Tradition

- This is like 75-80% of the course
- The major theorists of the Academic Tradition
    - Wilhelm Wundt
        - **psychological atomism**
        - would have people come in and tell him about a thought that they had had; **introspect**
        - thought that he would get a nice periodic table of psychological atoms, and instead he got thousands, which didn't make any sense, and were not organized in any sort of pattern
        - several other approaches followed
    - William James
        - **pragmatism**
        - believed Wundt was wrong for not studying what people really cared about
        - pragmatic approach 0 to study things that are meaningful to people
        - still important to North American psychology
        - "what does it matter?" is an important question
    - Watson & Skinner
        - took the approach of Behaviourism which dominated for about 40 years in North American psychology
        - believed that Wundt was not scientific enough; trying to study "thought" which cannot be observed
        - behaviourists felt that "thought" should not be studied
        - rationale was that if it is to be studied scientifically, it **must be observable**, i.e. behaviour
        - defined psychology as the scientific study of behaviour
        - made progress in a number of different domains
    - Kurt Lewin
        - Gestalt psychology
        - argued that Wundt made a wrong assumption, that the whole does not equal the sum of the parts
        - this was a powerful perspective
        - many times the **parts don't add up to the wholes** that we see and come to know and understand

- The Major Assumptions of the Academic Tradition
    1. Psychology is best understood when the causes are understood
        - we need to understand what causes a behaviour
        - the "why" is more important than the "how" or the "when"
        - if you understand the "why", you will know the "how" and the "when"
    2. People's thoughts and actions can be understood
        - thoughts and actions are not outside of the individual, are not irrelevant
        - by observing people, we can understand them
    3. Systematic study produces the fullest understanding
        - set up labs and experiments
            - Wundt's Lab - studies questions like "how long does one take to press a button"
            - William James' Lab

### <a name="1b5"></a>Three New Beginnings of Psychology

- in the 1960s and 70s, each of these traditions had a significant rebirth (new beginning)
- The Psychiatric Tradition
    - Humanistic Approach - The Third Wave
        - Carl Rogers
            - what Rogers tried to do in his therapy was very different from the Psychoanalytic Tradition
            - he **reflected back** to the individual what they were feeling
            - belief that people are basically good, and if you can let them get in touch with themselves, let them understand themselves, they will get better
            - they need to get in touch with this good inner part of who they are

- The Trait Tradition
    - developed and expanded from only two personality traits, Neuroticism and Extroversion, to big five important personality traits
        - **The Big Five Model of Personality** (OCEAN)
            1. Openness = intelligence
                - open to new experiences
                - more flexible in their thinking
                - more intelligent and have more education
            2. Conscientiousness
                - people who really stick to their goals
                - work hard and get things done
            3. _Extroversion_
            4. Agreeableness
                - how positive or negative of a person are you
            5. _Neuroticism_

- The Academic Tradition
    - The Cognitive Revolution
        - in the 60s and 70s there was huge growth and changes in the field from Behaviourism to Cognitive psychology
        - study of thought is one of the primary and important things about people
        - Albert Bandura - Observational Learning
        - it became clear that with Behaviourism there was much that could **not** be explained
        - we can learn by observing people rather than just being reinforced
        - cognitive revolution changed the face of psychology

## <a name="1c"></a>Research Methodology

### <a name="1c1"></a>Basic Philosophy of Science

- there are actually some big questions behind research methodology
- focus on the Academic Tradition
- keep in mind that the other traditions may not feel the same way
- our ideas can often be wrong
- we set out to demonstrate that our ideas are wrong
    - only draw firm conclusions when we have shown that the idea is wrong
- we accept an idea when we can't prove that it is wrong
    - this does not mean that someone else won't prove that the idea is wrong
    - good to have a healthy skepticism
- we might well prove them wrong later
- a number of things influence these ideas
    - what is accepted is often what is popular
    - what is accepted is shaped by political forces and social influences

### <a name="1c2"></a>Ways of Doing Research

- Tension between **Discovery** and **Explanation**
    - When something is discovered and is brand new, does it really mean anything?
    - some sciences are mostly about explanation; how things work, how things unfold
    - psychology is in the middle of these two extremes; always new discoveries, but explanations are crucial
    - different traditions have a different emphasis on discovery and explanation, and they do different types of research because of this
    - Psychiatric tradition uses mostly **case studies** in its research
        - One of Freud's famous case studies: Anna O.
            - Freud was Anna's therapist for many years
            - developed an unusual illness after a couple years of caring for her sick father
            - was blind even though there was nothing physically wrong with her
            - also had Glove Paralysis - paralysis of the hand
            - Freud believed that Anna was having fantasies about sex with her father, and that this was the cause of her problems
            - many modern psychologists feel that Anna was being sexually abused by her father
            - Freud thought that the tales of sexual abuse were all part of her fantasy

- Naturalistic Observation
    - similar to a case study but usually broader
    - observe, watch and see what happens
    - Jane Goodall's research with chimps
    - not very often done with people

- Survey Research
    - get a sample of populations, ask them questions, and see them how to answer it
    - goal is often to find out what the whole population is like, from surveying a sample portion of that population
    - problem of representativeness
        - e.g. political polling
    - establishes generality
    - sets up correlations between variables
    - when one thing happens, another thing tends to happen
    - Example of **Correlation** established by Survey Research
        - correlation between children watching violent television, and being violent
        - can randomly sample children throughout all of Canada to find out how much violent television they watch
        - then find out how often they use violent behaviour
        - what you find is a nice reliable correlation between children watching violence, and children acting the violence out
    - Correlation doesn't mean causation
        - just because children who watch too much violent television tend to be violent, doesn't necessarily mean that the television caused the violent behaviour

- Experiments
    - usually about establishing **causation**
    - Example of Correlation established by Survey Research
        - one possibility is that the violent television causes the violent behaviour, but is that really what is going on? maybe it is violent kids like to watch violent television
        - whenever you have a correlation, you have to think about in which direction does it go; does A cause B, or does B cause A, or other reason causes A and B, like following
        - perhaps the child is being abused by the parent(s), or is hyperactive
        - maybe it is education
        - there is always the possibility of having many variables when you have a correlation
        - causation establishes which one it is, which pattern is right

### <a name="1c3"></a>Research Methods - Surveys & Establishing Representatives

- Representative group of people
    - you want the people filling out the survey to correspond to the larger group that you want to generalize, to represent, so we do **Random Sampling** (different from [Random Assignment]((#1c4RandomAssignment))):
        - have a large group of people and take a small subset to do the survey on

- Need to ask unbiased questions
    - Anchoring Effects
        - give people something that you know is wrong, but it still influences the way they interpret the question, and then try to explain it
        - Is the Mississippi river longer or shorter than 500 miles? How long is it?
        - will actually give a short estimate because they are still influenced by the 500, even though everybody knows it's wrong
        - get 'anchored' by the other idea
    - Framing Effects
    - these are ways of asking questions in which the first part of the question, ends up influencing how the question will be answered

- don't want to have anchoring or framing effects because you will not get an accurate representation of the population
- surveys do a good job of establishing correlation among variables

### <a name="1c4"></a>Correlation Is Not Causation: How Do You Establish Causation?

- Correlation
    - when one variable changes, the other variable changes as well

- Time Order
    - need to know which comes first
    - Did the children watch the violent television and then become aggressive later on, or were they aggressive before viewing violence on television?
    - this is why many like to do longitudinal research

- Elimination of all other possible causes
    - Examples
        - Were the parents more aggressive?
        - Did they come from poor families?
        - Were the children who were more aggressive likely to be hyperactive?
    - Experiments do this through <a name="1c4RandomAssignment"></a>**random assignment**
        - randomly assign people to various conditions
        - take a small group in an experiment, and randomly have one half do one assignment, and the other half do another
    - Independent variable
        - what we think is going to be the cause
        - Experimental group - watches television
            - Control group - doesn't watch television
    - Dependent variable
        - behaviour that you are concerned with in the end; the effect
        - have children play together to see if they will fight
        - we want the dependent variable to be:
            - **valid** - measures what is supposed to measure
            - **reliable** - get the same outcome every time
            - example:
                - reliable, but not valid: ![reliable](imgs/1c3_reliable.jpg)
                - valid, but not reliable: ![valid](imgs/1c3_valid.jpg)

- How experiments try to establish causation
    - time order is built in independent variable leads to the dependent variable
    - eliminating other causes
    - randomly assigned

# <a name="2"></a>Lecture 02: Behavioural Neuroscience I

## <a name="2a"></a>The Nervous System and the Brain - The Big Picture

- Neuron
    - the basic cells that make up the nervous system
- Peripheral Nervous System
    - all the other nerves that run through the body which are not the brain or the spinal cord
- The Central Nervous System and the Brain
    - it is probably one of the frontiers that we understand the least of in psychology
- The Endocrine System
    - hormones
    - the different chemicals that float through the blood and also influence us
- Putting it all together - The Example of Hunger
    - not completely separate systems, all work together and influence each other
    - we can look at hunger as an example of how all these systems work together

## <a name="2b"></a>Neuron

### <a name="2b1"></a>The Neuron

![neuron](imgs/2b1_neuron.jpg)]

- A neuron looks like above, structure includes:
    - Myelin Sheath:
        - globular part of the neuron which are **not found in the neurons of the brain**
        - lets the electric current bounce from node to node, so that the impulse can travel quickly
        - neurons which are part of the Peripheral System and part of the spinal cord, actually work **faster than in the brain**
    - Dendrites
        - are found at the back end of the neuron (Terminal Branches of axon is the front end of a neuron)
    - Cell Body
        - the cell's life-support centre

- How do you take a piece of tissue, like a cell or a neuron, and have it conduct electricity?
    - Study of Sea Slugs

![travel](imgs/2b1_travel.jpg)
- How impulses travel down the Neuron
    - movement of ions in and out of the cell membrane is what creates the electricity and causes it to flow down the neuron (toward axon terminals)

![synapse](imgs/2b1_synapse.jpg)
- Synapse:
    - to simplify the process:
        - the action potential breaks down the vesicle containing neurotransmitters in axon terminal
        - then the neurotransmitters go through the synaptic gap
        - and it changes the ions in the next neuron
        - after it goes through, the neuron has to reuptake, in order for the transmitter can be used again, in a really short period of time
    - but it is not that simple because:
        - each neuron is connected from and to multiple other neurons
        - it's a very complex combination of a whole bunch of synapses coming together at once to determine whether the next one fires
        - i.e. some makes the next neuron firing, some makes the next neuron stop firing

### <a name="2b2"></a>Neurotransmitters

- Dopamine
    - very common especially in the brain
    - Parkinson's Disease
        - part of the cause is a deficiency of dopamine
        - marked by tremors
        - very important in the coordination of movement
    - also important in attention and emotion
    - Schizophrenia
        - marked by an excess of dopamine in various parts of the brain

- Serotonin
    - involved in mood, hunger, sleep and arousal
    - it affects things widely in the brain
    - a deficiency of serotonin is a cause for insomnia
    - deficiencies are also associated with depression

- Norepinephrine
    - more related to alertness and arousal
    - also associated with depression

- Acetylcholine
    - the most common neurotransmitter
    - involved in muscle movement
    - Alzheimer's Disease
        - the neurons that work through acetylcholine get ruined with Alzheimer's
    - also involved in learning and memory

- Endorphins
    - involved in pain regulation
    - when injured, the body naturally releases these endorphins which allow you to handle a lot more pain
    - heroine and morphine mimic this neurotransmitter

### <a name="2b3"></a>How Drugs Affect Neurotransmitters

![neurotransmitters](imgs/2b3_neurotransmitters.jpg)

- Here is a picture showing the synapse:
    - at the synapse gap, neurotransmitters come across have complex shapes
    - on the other side of dendrites, receptor sites with complex shape that neurotransmitters fitting in
    - when it fits in, it changes the receiving cell membrane, and starts/stops the impulse depends on the type of neurotransmitter
- Drugs mimics the shape of neurotransmitter, 2 ways for drugs to work:
    1. **Agonist**: by acting just like the neurotransmitter, and in effect making It think that there is more of it; good if there is a deficiency of neurotransmitters
    2. **Antagonist**: others act like blockers and keep the neurotransmitter from having as much of an effect; good if there is too much of a neurotransmitter

## <a name="2c"></a>Divisions of the Nervous System

- Nervous System
    - Peripheral
        - Autonomic (controls self-regulated action of internal organs and glands)
            - Sympathetic (arousing): gets you ready for fight or flight
            - Parasympathetic (calming): lets you build up all your energy
        - Somatic (controls voluntary movements of skeletal muscles)
    - Central (brain and spinal cord)

### <a name="2c1"></a>The Peripheral Nervous System

- Somatic Nervous System
    - controls voluntary muscles and their movement

- Autonomic Nervous System
    - controls the glands
    - controls the muscles related to our organs
    - although possible to override by conscious thought, for the most part these reactions occur spontaneously

![autonomic](imgs/2c1_autonomic.jpg)

|     Organ     |                     Sympathetic                     |          Parasympathetic          |
|     :---:     |                        :---:                        |               :---:               |
| Eyeball       | Dilates pupil                                       | Contracts pupil                   |
| Heart         | Accelerates heartbeat                               | Slows heartbeat                   |
| Stomach       | Inhibits digestion                                  | Stimulates digestion              |
| Liver         | Stimulates glucose release by liver                 | Stimulates gallbladder            |
| Adrenal gland | Stimulates secretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine | -                                 |
| Kidney        | Relaxes bladder                                     | Contracts bladder                 |
| Penis (male)  | Stimulates ejaculation                              | Stimulates erection of sex organs |

### <a name="2c2"></a>The Central Nervous System

![central](imgs/2c2_central.jpg)

- The Spinal Cord
    - carries information from the Peripheral Nervous system up to the brain
    - does some 'thinking', in that it controls some responses
    - these responses are typically referred to as reflexes
    - type of neurons that cannot only transmit things, but can route things different ways; almost makes some primitive types of decisions
- The Brain
    - does almost all the processing other than the simple reflexes
- Three areas of the brain you need to know about

![brain](imgs/2c2_brain.jpg)

1. Brainstem
    - it is injury to the brainstem that usually kills
    - controls all the vital functions
    - very crucial even though it is only a small part of the brain
2. Lymbic system
    - controls motivation and emotion
    - very important for memory
3. Cerebral Cortex
    - separates us from animals

### <a name="2c3"></a>How the Spinal Cord Controls Reflexes

A Simple Reflex:

![reflex](imgs/2c3_reflex.jpg)

1. In this simple hand-withdrawal reflex, information  is carried from skin receptors along a sensory neuron to the spinal cord (shown by the red arrows). From here it is passed via interneurons to motor neurons that lead to muscles in the hand and arm (blue arrows).
2. Because this reflex involves only the spinal cord, the hand jerks away from the candle flame even before information about the event has reached the brain, causing the experience of pain.

### <a name="2c4"></a>The Brain

![brainstem](imgs/2c4_brainstem.jpg)

![brainstem2](imgs/2c4_brainstem2.jpg)

- The Four Parts of the Brain Stem
    - Medulla
        - absolutely critical in keeping us alive
        - controls the **heartbeat and breathing**
        - when someone break their neck, the Medulla get damaged and he's probably dead
    - Reticular formation
        - controls **attention, alertness, and reactivity**
        - can be thought of as the **accelerator of the brain**
        - basic function that regulates the overall amount of brain activity
    - Thalamus
        - sensory switching point
        - crucial for **vision and other senses**
        - beginning processes of our senses come about

- Cerebellum
    - crucial for **movement and coordination of movement**
    - crucial for **balance**

![lymbic](imgs/2c4_lymbic.jpg)
- The Lymbic System
    - Pituitary gland
        - important in the production of many necessary **hormones**
    - Hypothalamus
        - crucial for **hunger**
        - controls the hormones of the Pituitary gland
        - some influence on other emotions as well, particularly **pleasure**
    - Amygdala
        - important for a number of things, including **anger**
    - Hippocampus
        - crucial for memory and for laying down the functions of **memory**
        - damage can cause severe types of memory disorders

- The Cerebral Cortex - Basic Divisions
    - Occipital lobe
        - heavily involved in **vision**
    - Parietal lobe
        - involved in **language and spacial recognition**
    - Temporal lobe
        - involved in **hearing, memory and mood**
        - important in some of the functions of the Hippocampus and the Lymbic system
    - Frontal lobe
        - important in **reasoning and thinking**
        - involved in the **complex processing of information**

![movementsensetouch](imgs/2c4_movementsensetouch.jpg)

- The Cerebral Cortex Functional Divisions - Movement and Sense of Touch
    - Output: Motor Cortex
    - Input: Sensory Cortex
    - Note that the **left** hemisphere section receives/controls **right** side of body
    - the brain has no actual sensors for pain
    - there is a lot of specificity with the sensory and motor cortex
    - seizures occur when there is too much electrical activity in the motor cortex
    - motor cortex sends off charges to make movement throughout the body
    - in the case of a stroke, the motor cortex is damaged, and whatever is damaged is what will be paralyzed
    - often the stroke is only on one side of the brain, causing only one side of the body to be paralyzed
    - some people cannot move a part of their body, but can feel it
    - other people can move a part of their body, but cannot feel it as a result of damage in the Sensory cortex, which did not affect the corresponding part of the Motor cortex

![hearingvision](imgs/2c4_hearingvision.jpg)

- The Cerebral Cortex Functional Divisions - Hearing and Visions
    - Vision cortex
        - initially the sensory information comes in through the eyes, but it is processed by the Visual cortex at the back of the brain
    - Hearing cortex
        - processed near the sensor (ear)
        - damage to this area can cause deafness with no possibility of correction

![leftright](imgs/2c4_leftright.jpg)

- The Cerebral Cortex Functional Divisions - Left and Right Sides of the Brain: thick area between the two brains for exchanging information
    - Corpus Callosum
        - think area between the two brains for exchanging information
    - Epileptic Study: ![corpuscallosum](imgs/2c4_corpuscallosum.jpg)
        - in the 1950s there was not much that they could do to help epileptics with their seizures
        - in order to stop the seizures they severed the corpus callosum; they cut the two sides of the brain apart
        - helps to reduce the number of seizures dramatically because the electrical impulses do not spread to the other side
        - this led to a new understanding of the brain
        - what was discovered was that the two sides of the brain actually perform different functions
        - left side in particular is more verbal; able to produce language in most people
        - right side is better at visual processing and coordinating; can understand simple language
        - some left-handed people have a brain structured like a right-hander, others have it reversed

- Mike Gazanaga Study
    - helps to explain the 'executive' function of the left brain, the ability to explain and interpret what is going on
    - brain is able to do this even when it is wrong
    - right brain can process visual stimuli, and can process commands
    - when he would flash "Get up" to the right side of the brain, a number of people would get up
    - their left brain was unaware of why they were getting up because it has no access to that information
    - everyone of them could instantaneously come up with an explanation as to why they stood up
    - left side of the brain is very good at rationalizing your own behaviour
    - Would the right side of the brain be better at picking up what emotion is being shown on a face?
        - still works to be done, no one knows...

## <a name="2d"></a>The Endocrine System

![endocrine](imgs/2d_endocrine.jpg)

- **Pituitary gland**: secretes many different hormones, some of Which affect other glands
- **Hypothalamus**: brain region controlling the pituitary gland
- **Testes**: secrets male sex hormones
- **Ovaries**: secretes female sex hormones
- **Adrenal glands**: inner part, called the medulla helps trigger the "fight or flight" response
- **Pancreas**: regulates the level of sugar in the blood
- **Parathyroids**: help regulate the level of calcium In the blood
- **Thyroid gland**: affects metabolism, among other things

## <a name="2e"></a>Putting It All Together - The Case of Hunger

- When we don't eat for a while, what makes us feel hungry?
    - stomach contractions carry hunger signal through the peripheral nervous system to the hypothalamus
    - blood sugar levels as interpreted and controlled by the liver and pancreas send message to the hypothalamus
    - **lateral hypothalamus** is stimulated and releases the hormone orexin which heightens hunger, like the following picture

![hungrybrain](imgs/2e_hungrybrain.jpg)

- When we eat, what makes us no longer feel hungry?
    - stomach expands and this message is transmitted to the hypothalamus
    - blood sugar levels as interpreted and controlled by the liver and pancreas send message of higher levels to the hypothalamus
    - insulin is also released
    - **ventromedial hypothalamus** is stimulated and which leads to the feeling of satiation and helps stop the eating

- Damage to the Hypothalamus
    - if there is a lesion to the lateral hypothalamus then rats basically starve themselves to death and virtually eat nothing
    - also seem lethargic and depressed
    - if the ventromedial hypothalamus is damaged, then rats basically will never stop eating and they get very fat

## <a name="2f"></a>Overarching Principles

![overarch](imgs/2f_overarch.jpg)

- Structures of the brain and the various systems work together in coordinated, overlapping, and redundant systems
- It incorrect to say one part is completely controlling something - that is way too simplistic
- Despite all this specificity and complexity the brain has quite a bit of plasticity
    - if an area is damaged other areas can take over
    - particularly true for young children

# <a name="3"></a>Lecture 03: Behavioural Neuroscience II

## <a name="3a"></a>The Senses
### <a name="3a1"></a>Vision
![eye](imgs/3a1_eye.jpg)

- Structure of eye
    - **Iris**: how much the light gets in
    - **Pupil**: just a hole
    - **Cornea**: protective surface
    - **Lens**: right behind the pupil, focuses the light race on the Retina(it revert the image)
    - **Retina**: flashed on it upside down
    - **Fovea**: actual spot on Retina, right behind the pupil, center of our vision, sensitive to colour
    - **Optic nerve** (to brain's visual cortex): take signal from retina and transmit it to brain

![retina](imgs/3a1_retina.jpg)
- Retina
    - How Retina processes the light:
        1. Light entering eye triggers photochemical reaction in rods and cones at back of retina
        2. Chemical reaction in turn activates bipolar cells
        3. Bipolar cells then active the ganglion cells, the axons of which converge to form the optic nerve. This nerve transmits information to the visual cortex in the brain's occipital lobe.
    - 3 types of cells involves in the procedure:
        1. Ganglion cell
        2. Bipolar cell
        3. Sensors
            - Rod: _responsible for black and white vision_
            - Cone: _responsible for colour vision_

![eyecortex](imgs/3a1_eyecortex.jpg)

- From the Eye to the Cortex
    - the part of the brain that helps to understand things is the cortex
    - visual cortex takes the light that is coming in, and turns it into shapes

- Feature Detection
    - How can you tell that a table is square?
    - in the cortex individual cells respond to lines at various angles
    - take the symbols of lines and create a pattern
    - cells converge to create our perception of what we see
    - higher level cells provide even more perception
    - all of this happens virtually instantaneously
    - this all is done with massive parallel processing of information
    - it is still not completely understood as to how the visual cortex organizes all this information

- Colour Vision
    - Young-Helmholtz Trichromatic Theory
        - theory comes primarily from studying the retina
        - three types of cones in the retina, which respond to three types of light
        - primary colors: red, green, blue
        - all other colours can be made from these three
        - could just the specificity of the cones produce these different colours?
        - consistent with this theory are colour-blind individuals
            - red and green - problem with either green or red cones
            - blue and green - no distinction between blue and green cones
        - theory works well untill we talk about the colour yellow
            - brain responds to yellow as a primary colour
    - Opponent-Process Theory
        - there are actually three sets of opposing pairs of colours
        - 3 opponent color pairs
            - black/white
            - red/green
            - blue/yellow
        - explains **afterimage effect**
            - Why do you get those opposing colours?
            - when staring at the colours, the neurons associated with those colours will fire, but they will eventually wear out
            - the lack of firing is now interpreted as if the red, blue and white are firing thus creating the afterimage effect
            - after image effect is when the brain thinks that the reverse colours are firing
    - Both theory are probably true
        - at the retinal level, you have the three types of cones which work together to produce all the different colours
        - true in the thalamus, higher up in the brain as it is processing things

### <a name="3a2"></a>Hearing

![ear](imgs/3a2_ear.jpg)

- The Parts of the ear
    - **Outer ear**: Pinna and part of auditory canal
    - **Auditory canal**
    - **Eardrum**: begin of actual signal, it vibrates
    - **Bones of the middle ear**: 3 bones, transmitted mechanically
    - **Oval window**: where stirrup attaches
    - **Cochlea**: like seashell, turns physical stimulus into neural impulses
    - <a name="3a2_canals"></a>**Semicircular canals**: important to [balance](#3a3_balance)
    - **Vestibular sacs**: have nothing to do with hearing
    - **Auditory nerve**

![cochlea](imgs/3a2_cochlea.jpg)

- A Closer Look at the Cochlea
    - sound comes in and make eardrum vibrate
    - the vibrations move the hammer, anvil and stirrup which push against fluid inside the cochlea
    - wave get flushing in the cochlea
    - cochlear membrane (basilar) with protruding hair cells, the waves bend the hairs
    - the bending of the hairs starts the nerve impulse that really allows you to hear

- How does this cochlear fluid get turned in to a neural impulse? Pitch perception
    - Place theory
        - the particular hairs in the cochlear membrane which get bent over by the wave, will determine what type of pitch there will be
        - big waves are going to hit back a lot further creating one pitch which will be low sounds; low sounds make bigger waves
        - higher sounds are going to make littler waves, which lands closer in, creating high pitch sound
        - this theory can't explain the high sounds that we are capable of hearing
    - Frequency Theory
        - it is the speed of the waves in the cochlea that determines the pitch
        - big waves go slower, and little waves go faster
    - Both theories seem to be true
        - Place theory works well for high sounds, and it is the particular hairs that matter
        - Frequency theory explains low sounds, it is the frequency of the waves

### <a name="3a3"></a>The Other Senses: Taste, Smell, Touch, Pain, and Balance

![tongue](imgs/3a3_tongue.jpg)

- Taste
    - four basic tastes - **sweet**, **sour**, **salty** and **bitter**
    - tongue has tastebuds that respond to these different tastes
    - taste sensations are created by **chemical reactions** on the tastebuds
    - heavily influenced by smell
    - together they respond to much of the same stimuli - this is called **sensory interaction**
    - often what enhances the flavour of food is the smell rather than the particular combination of sweet, salty, sour and bitter

- Smell
    - occurs due to a chemical reaction in the olfactory membrane that creates smell
    - we still do not understand exactly how receptors in the olfactory membrane work
    - chemical that is in the air gets picked up by these receptors in the olfactory membrane which creates a neural impulse to the brain
    - odors can powerfully evoke memories and emotions

![smell](imgs/3a3_smell.jpg)

- Structure of smell sensor:
    - **Nasal passage**: sense smell
    - **Receptor cells in the olfactory membrane**: some chemical reactions occurs here
    - **Olfactory nerve**: set up impulse to the brain
    - **Olfactory bulb**: pick up impulse situated, where occur in lymbic system, actually closely related with it, and that's maybe why order cause strong memories, because it is close to Hippocampus, which is crucial to memory, also lymbic system is also crucial to emotional reactions (Amygdala)

- Touch
    - organ for touch is **skin**
    - there are specialized nerve endings in the skin, but these do not seem to have a relationship with what we feel
    - our skin is sensitive to **pressure**, **warmth** (not hot), **cold**, and **pain**
    - these four sensitivities give rise to quite varied sensations
    - it is interesting that with that the brain has such an influence on that sense of touch when it doesn't on so many other sensations
    - hot = warm + cold, an interesting physical illusion
    - wet = cold + pressure
    - feeling itchy comes from overstimulated pain receptors

- Pain
    - more is known about pain, but the more that is known, the more difficult it is to understand
    - there is no definable area of the brain that is related to pain
    - what we tend to remember about the pain is the **height** of the pain, not the duration
    - Gate Control Theory
        - suggests that the spinal cord has a neurological gate that either blocks pain signals or allows them to travel to the brain
        - distractions can close the gate
        - brain is blocking out the pain response with lots of other responses
        - endorphins, which are the body's natural pain killers, may shut the gate right at the spinal cord so that pain can't travel to the brain

- <a name="3a3_balance"></a>Balance
    - feeling of be disoriented or dizzy - kinesthetic sense
    - seems to occur through two very different sense organs
    - the joints and muscles tell us the position of our body
    - also the [semi-circular canals](#3a2_canals) in the ears tell us the vestibular sense or the position of our head
    - it is those grains hitting the hairs that gives us this sense of balance and orientation, particularly for the head

## <a name="3b"></a>Focus on University of Waterloo Research – Synaesthesia

- Synaesthesia
    - blending of sensory perception; blending of sensations
    - Digit-colour synaesthesia
        - a particular colour is projected onto a number
        - individuals have different colour ranges for the numbers
    - nobody really knows how this develops, in fact it is a very rare condition
    - researchers at the University of Waterloo have only identified 80-90 people in the world

## <a name="3c"></a>Coordination of Language in the Brain

![language](imgs/3c_language.jpg)

- How do we read out load?
    - Visual cortex: _receives written words as visual stimulation_
    - Angular gyrus: _transforms visual representations into an auditory code_
    - Wernicke's area: _interprets auditory code_
        - stroke on this area: can produce speech but none of it makes any sense; affects the interpretation of speech
    - Broca's area: _controls speech muscles via the motor cortex_
        - stroke on this area: can understand speech, but have a hard time producing speech
    - Motor cortex: _word is pronounced_

## <a name="3d"></a>Brain Coordination While We Sleep

![sleepstages](imgs/3d_sleepstages.jpg)

- The Active Sleeping Brain
    - activity in our brain is remarkably varied while we sleep
    - five stages of sleep defined by brain activity that occur when we sleep
        - **Awake**, relaxed: Alpha waves
        - **Stage 1 sleep**: lightly sleep
        - **Stage 2 sleep**: little peaks, called _Spindle_ (burst of activity)
        - **Stage 3 sleep**: bigger waves and higher amplitude
        - **Stage 4 sleep**: really high amplitude (waves are called _Delta waves_)
        - **REM sleep**: REM stands for _rapid eye movement_, happens when dreaming


![sleepcycle](imgs/3d_sleepcycle.jpg)

- The Sleep Cycle
    - Awake to deeper and deeper stages of sleep
    - Then REM sleep
    - more Stage 4 in first 2-3 hours, more REM afterwards

- Why do we sleep
    - when we don't sleep we feel terrible
    - why do we spend roughly a third of our lives sleeping?
    - when people don't sleep they are not alert and are more likely to get into accidents
    - but this doesn't answer why we need to sleep

- Why do we dream?
    - Freud
        - believed that dreams produced wish fulfillment
        - thought that we worked out all of our fantasies through our dreams
        - interpreted sex and violence into any type of dream
    - Modern Theory
        - Activation-synthesis
        - dreams result from random neural activity in the head which the brain attempts to make sense of
        - whatever pathways or connections that have been activated during the day, the more likely to be activated again at night, particularly when dreaming
        - need dreams for memory consolidation and cognitive development

![dreamlife](imgs/3d_dreamlife.jpg)

- Sleep Throughout the Lifetime
    - as you get old, you spend most of your time awake
    - when you are younger, you spend more time to sleep, especially when you are a baby, you take lot of time dreaming, why?
        - the connections that are developing need to be reinforced, dreams foster this sort of cognitive development
        - dreaming facilitates learning

# <a name="4"></a>Lecture 04: Developmental Psychology I

## <a name="4a"></a>What is Behaviourism?

- Classical Conditioning
    - Pavlov and his dogs
- Operant Conditioning
    - Skinner and his pigeons
- Language Acquisition
    - How is it that we learn to speak?
- Observational Learning
    - the Bobo Doll

## <a name="4b"></a>Classical Conditioning

- Pavlov and his dogs
    - had test tubes hocked up to saliva glands of dogs to collect the spit
    - noticed after a few days of giving them food, that every time he walked up to the dogs to give them food, the saliva would start to flow
    - the question became, _Why were they salivating before the food was given to them?_

![pavlovdog](imgs/4b_pavlovdog.jpg)

- Procedure:
    - **An unconditioned stimulus (UCS) produces an unconditioned response**: Introduce food, and dog starts salivation
    - **A neutral stimulus produces no salivation response**: use metronome, no salivation
    - **The UCS is repeatedly presented just after neutral stimulus. The UCS to produce an unconditioned response**: let the dog think the food is associate with metronome by repeatedly let the dog hear metronome when show it the food
    - **The neutral stimulus alone now produces a conditioned response (CR), thereby becoming a conditioned stimulus (CS)**: now let the dog hear metronome again then the dog starts salivation

- What is learning and unlearning?
    - In Classical conditioning, learning is the association of a conditioned stimulus or neutral stimulus With an  unconditioned stimulus to the extent that the conditioned stimulus produces the unconditioned response
    - Pavlov didn't understand the implications of this very well: he did not realize what learning could come from this
    - John Watson
        - one of the early American behaviourists
        - not going to study thoughts, but will study what is observable
        - uses Pavlovian principles to teach
        - "You give me twenty children, and I can turn them into anything!"
        - Little Albert was taught to be terrified of anything that is soft and furry
        - the idea was that you could teach something to someone which did not make any sense, and they could learn to be afraid of it
        - in some ways this is a model for phobia

- Process of Generalization
    - occurs **when the conditioned stimulus is changed slightly, and the conditioned response still happens**
    - screaming and crying is the conditioned response, it is something that can be observed

- Discrimination
    - occurs **when the conditioned stimulus is changed, and the conditioned response doesn't happen**
    - starting to get unlearning
    - this would happen if Little Albert was afraid of rats, but not bunnies, and could make the distinction between them
    - can teach this process by only presenting the unconditioned stimulus with the rat and never with the bunny

- Extinction
    - occurs **when the conditioned stimulus, now the unconditioned response, no longer produces the response**
    - according to the theory, extinction should happen eventually if the unconditioned stimuli is no longer paired with the conditioned stimuli

- Problems with Classical Conditioning
    - the only behaviour that can be affected is one that the organism, the dog or Little Albert, would normally do
    - you cannot get the organism to do new behaviours

## <a name="4c"></a>Operant Conditioning

- what operant conditioning allows for, and allows to happen, is behaviours that **would not naturally occur**
- Skinner proposed that **any behaviour that anyone engages in has been learnt through operant conditioning**

- What is Operant Conditioning?
How does an organism learn to do this it doesn't normally do? How do you ever get behaviour that doesn't occur as an unconditional response (UCR)?
    - Skinner proposed that behaviour that is rewarded will occur more often in the future
    - behaviour that is not rewarded will occur less often
    - according to Skinner, almost all behaviour is shaped in this way
    - what Skinner argued, and very conclusively demonstrated, was that **complex behaviours can be shaped through rewards**

- What is Operant Conditioning?
    - Skinner and his pigeons
        - by rewarding pigeons with food for doing behaviours which he wanted them to do, he could teach them to do miraculous things
        - playing Beethoven is a very complex behaviour and is not something that pigeons do naturally
        - learning is the acquisition of new behaviours

- Types of Reinforcers
    - **Positive reinforcer**: getting good things
    - **Negative reinforcer**: removing bad things (also a good thing)
    - both positive and negative reinforcers actually promote behaviours, make them more likely to occur
    - note that a negative reinforcer is **not** a punishment
        - Skinner thought punishment was a bad way to teach
        - when things happen that are perceived as bad, or when good things are removed, you don't know what to do
        - punishment often leads to **inaction** rather than action; learning should be about producing actions
        - rather than acquiring new behaviours, it lead to the shutting down of behaviour
    - **Primary reinforcers**: pleasant in their own right
    - **Conditioned (secondary) reinforcers**: pleasant through association (like money)
        - note here that this builds on classical conditioning
        - associated the conditioned stimuli (money) with the unconditioned stimuli (what the money can buy that is pleasant in its own right)

- One thing in common with classical conditioning and operant conditioning
    - both argue that to understand behaviour and where it comes from, you don't need to know anything about what is inside the head (the big black box)
    - thoughts are epiphenomenon; things that are there but which have no importance or influence
    - all you need to know is what can be observed
    - any behaviour can be explained without looking at though

## <a name="4d"></a>Language Acquisition

- Was language something that was learned through behaviourism?
    - Skinner argued that language was learnt through reinforcement
    - basic idea is that children receive all kinds of reinforcement and affection from their parents when they first begin to "babble", which carries on as the child begins to use words and sentences

- Chomsky
    - believed that **language learning was innate, that there is an inborn ability to learn language**
    - there is a critical period early on in which everyone learns language
    - Chomsky was a linguist, not a psychologist
    - argued that Skinner was naive in thinking that parents could teach their children to talk simply through the use of reinforcement

- The Bottom Line
    - behaviourism is clearly wrong in this debate
    - children learn language incredibly fast
    - babies can actually hear all the different ranges of sound that people make
    - after about a year, children's brains become used to the language that they hear, and can no longer hear certain sounds
    - children can learn thousands of words a day and can pick up a foreign language without any effort
    - all of this suggests that they are not learning by reinforcement but that there is a built-in ability to learn language

## <a name="4e"></a>Observational Learning

- Bandura
    - believed that **people did not have to learn through rewards or punishments, but could learn by watching others**
    - in order for this to happen one must have thoughts to intervene between what is going on
    - it is not just a matter of being rewarded, one must make an inference that the same thing could happen to themselves

- The Bobo Doll Study
    - the adult proceeded to "beat" the bobo doll up
    - what would the children play with? in particular, would they beat up the bobo doll?
        - the child who did not see the adult with the bobo doll, hit it an average of 2 times
        - those who did watch hit the doll an average of 62 times

- What did these children learn?
    - according to Sandura, they learned how to be violent
    - Bandura felt that this had some implications for the effects of violence on television, and in the movies, on children
    - argued that children learn that it is good to be violent by watching people being rewarded for violent behaviour
    - what it did was say to behaviourism that do matter

## <a name="4f"></a>The Big Picture: The Fundamental Issues Being Addressed

- Big Difference between Nature vs Nurture
    - behaviourists focused most on nurture
    - Watson believed that he could take twenty children and turn them into anything
    - Skinner believed that he could create a utopian society through behaviourist principles
    - nature side of things, children have this inborn ability to learn language

- Could Behaviourism explain what was really important?
    - How applicable is the science of psychology to everyday life?
    - Can it explain what really goes on?
    - behaviourism could not explain how we learn by watching, nor could it explain how we learn language.

- Is there still a role for behaviourism?
    - behaviourism can still be used to control some behaviours

## <a name="5c"></a>Cognitive Development

### <a name="5c1"></a>An Introduction to Piaget's Theory

- Piaget's Theory
    - early psychologist who started his work in the early 1900s and was still active in the 1950s
    - rather than doing experiments, Piaget developed his theory by actually playing with children
    - based on what they did, he would design theories about how they develop
    - proposed that there were stages of development, which is one of the controversial aspects of his theory

- Do you think of development as being in stages in which one thing must happen before the next, or do you think of development as being continuous?

- **Schema**
    - a way to think about the world, to understand the world
    - Piaget argued that in each of the stages, there is one type of way of thinking about the world that is the dominate schema; the way to think about the world at that point in time

- When you have schemas, two different processes can happen:
    1. Assimilation
        - happens within a stage, which means that you **add more information to your schema**
        - you assimilate information to your schema, the way you think about the world
    2. Accomodation
        - **the schema is changed when new information comes in**, you change the way you think about the world

- Example of Schemas - The Classroom
    - At the beginning, you come to classroom, start to study and take notes, that becomes the impression of the classroom, and this is assimilation
    - Sometime later, you get into the same room again, but in the room it starts plays, then it becomes a theatre and your mind will change too, this is accommodation (to the new experience)

### <a name="5c2"></a>Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development

- Piaget's Stages of Development

| Typical Age Range          | Description of stage                                                                                                                   | Developmental Phenomena                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Birth to nearly 2 years    | **Sensorimotor**: Experiencing the world through senses and actions (looking, touching, mouthing and grasping)                         | Object permanence; Stranger anxiety                  |
| About 2 to 6 years         | **Preoperational**: Representing things with words and images but lacking logical reasoning                                            | Pretend play; Egocentrism; Language development      |
| About 2 to 6 years         | **Concrete operational**: Thinking logically about concrete events; grasping concrete analogies and performing arithmetical operations | Conservation; Mathematical transformations           |
| About 12 through adulthood | **Formal operational**: Abstract reasoning                                                                                             | Abstract logic; Potential for mature moral reasoning |

- Some notes:
    - Object permanence:
        - developed at about eight months
        - Piaget believes that early on a child will only recognize an object if they are currently sensing it
        - if it is not in their sensory field it is gone, it does not exist
        - object permanence is the idea that an object retains its form and is there even when it cannot be sensed
    - Stranger anxiety:
        - intense fear of people the child does not know
        - the child learns the permanency of the mother and protests their absence
        - stranger anxiety develops once the child has object permanence
    - Lacking logical reasoning:
        - Lack of conservation: even with same count, child in this age will usually choose the ones that takes more space (looks more)
    - Egocentrism:
        - can't see someone else's perspective
        - can only see things from their perspective
    - Conservation and Mathematical transformation:
        - according to Piaget, in order to get these problems right, they must have objects in front of them
    - Formal operation:
        - this distinction between concrete operations and formal operations is the most controversial aspect of Piaget's theory

### <a name="5c3"></a>Extensions and Qualifications of Piaget's Theory

- Does object permanence really emerge at or around 8 months of age?
    - No. We are going to see that children actually understand object permanence in a more general way much earlier on, and learn bits and pieces of it at a time.

- Focus on University of Waterloo Research - Infant Cognition (Dr. Andrea Aguiar)
    - demonstrates that children do understand object permanence earlier than 8 months and that it happens in two week intervals
    - 90% of the babies in the research project showed this response
    - at 2.5 months there seems to be a simple rule, if it is behind something you won't see it
        - Please note: in this research two dolls were used. This is why the dolls are not seen in the gaps.
    - at 2.5 to 3.0 months they learn about seeing things in gaps
    - between 3.0 to 3.5 months they learn about heights

- Egocentrism and Research on Theory of Mind
    - the notion that you can understand what someone else is thinking
    - remember that Piaget believed that egocentrism went on until children reached about seven
    - theory of mind makes a parallel point to the research on object permanence
    - gradually children begin to gain more and more of a theory of mind with age
    - there are different aspects that they understand about what the other person is thinking
    - as adults we may understand that we all think differently, but we don't have a complete grasp of what the other person is actually thinking
    - A puzzle:
        - This is Sally. This is Anne.
        - Sally puts her ball in the red cupboard
        - Sally goes away
        - Anne moves the ball to the blue cupboard
        - Where will Sally look for her ball?
    - Children's response:
        - have children consistently say that Sally would look in the blue cupboard where they know it is
        - they think the other person knows what they know
        - begin to see children solving this puzzle much earlier than seven

- Development is more continuous and happens earlier than Piaget proposed
    - children begin to learn the tasks that Piaget set out much earlier than he recognized
    - methodology was great for figuring out what children do, but not fine grained enough to explain when they begin the various phases, nor that it is a gradual process
    - Dr. Andrea Aguiar's research is a great example of the modern trend in developmental psychology, noting some important extensions and qualifications of Piaget's theory

## <a name="5d"></a>Social Development

### <a name="5d1"></a>Attachment Theory

- Harlow's Monkey Studies
    - what Harlow did was separate baby monkeys from their mothers to be raised by two different types of mothers
    - Which surrogate mother will the monkey like better?
    - the monkey chooses the soft terryclothed mother, and reaches across only to get food
    - Harlow believed that these studies demonstrated the importance of care and nurturing of the young, and that contact is crucial in the early development

- The theory behind attachment theory
    - we have an inborn need to bond with our caregiver
    - this bonding is crucial for the social development of the child
    - that relationship will be the basis for all other relationships that that individual will have

- The strange situation
    - developed by Mary Ainsworth
    - have mothers have infant about 12 months old
    - make mother going into a room with lots of toys, lots of things to do
    - then make mother leave
    - What happens to the child? How does the child respond when the mother leaves?
    - How did the child respond when the mother came back?
    - **Secure attachment pattern**: child is somewhat upset to see mother leave, but very happy when mother returns
    - **Anxious attachment pattern**: the child would scream and be very upset when mother left, and would be overly clingy when she returned
    - **Avoidant attachment pattern**: child is either upset or not when mother leaves, but does not want to have anything to do with her when she comes back
    - These patterns can be divided into secure and insecure patterns:
        - Secure attachment: a child who misses the mother seeks reunion, but is able to deal with time on their own
        - Insecure attachment: either doesn't miss their mother or isn't able to deal with being on their own
    - What different does this make?

- What attachment predicts
    - can predict the number of friends children will make when going to school
        - securely attached infants between 1 and 1.5 are better at making friends and have more friends when in school
        - sense of social competence when being securely attached
    - there is evidence that suggests that people who are good with having secure attachments are the ones who develop good adult relationships
    - this would suggest that trust can be taught through a stable, loving relationship with the primary caregiver

### <a name="5d2"></a>Erikson's Theory

- theory goes from infancy to old age
- Erikson's ideas have some Freudian roots to them
- believed that there were certain challenges that needed to be dealt with at certain points in one's life
- whether you succeed in accomplishing those challenges is the primary social issue at each stage in life

- Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development

| Typical Age Range                        | Issues                       | Description of Task                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _Infancy_ (to 1 year)                    | Trust vs. mistrust           | If needs are dependably met, infants develop a sense of basic trust                                                                                         |
| _Toddlerhood_ (1 to 2 years)             | Autonomy vs. shame and doubt | Toddlers learn to exercise will and do things for themselves, or they doubt their abilities                                                                 |
| _Preschooler_ (3 to 5 years)             | Initiative vs. guilt         | Preschoolers learn to initiate task and carry out plans, or they feel guilty about efforts to be independent                                                |
| _Elementary school_ (6 years to puberty) | Competence vs. inferiority    | Children learn the pleasure of applying themselves to tasks, or they feel inferior                                                                          |
| _Adolescence_ (teen years into 20s)      | Identity vs. role confusion  | Teenagers work at refining a sense of self by testing roles and then integrating them to form a single identity, or they become confused about who they are |
| _Young adulthood_ (20s to early 40s)     | Intimacy vs. isolation       | Young adults struggle to form close relationships and gain the capacity for intimate love, or they feel socially isolated                                   |
| _Middle adulthood_ (40s to 60s)           | Generativity vs. stagnation  | The middle-aged discover a sense of contributing to the world, usually through family and work, or they may feel a lack of purpose                          |
| _Late adulthood_ (late 60s and up)       | Integrity vs. despair        | When reflecting on his or her life, the older adult may feel a sense of satisfaction or failure                                                             |

- Note:
    - From research it is quite clear that this theory isn't quite right

- Criticisms of Erikson's theory
    - one of the big criticisms of Erikson's theory is that it is culture bound
    - the average age that people are getting married is much later than in the 30s when Erikson developed this theory
    - How many individuals actually figure out their sense of identity while in their adolescence?
    - autonomy, the idea that we are separate individuals living our lives our own way, is a fairly western idea and not nearly as true for many other cultures
    - theory doesn't do a very good job of explaining who is likely to have problems and who isn't
    - example of Bill Clinton
    - example of premature babies
    - theory is more of a framework rather than any type of serious stage model

### <a name="5d3"></a>Gender Development

- A common observation is that children's behaviour, and particularly their play, is gender stereotyped.
    - Is it the way their parents treat them?
    - we see in attachment theory and in Erikson's theory that parents shape their children and determine what they will be like
    - a number of studies have shown that parents do not really have that much influence over their children, especially in gender stereotyped behaviour
    - there is no relationship between the way in which parents treat their children, what values the parents have, and how the children tum out
    - learning gender Stereotypes is almost like learning an accent
    - we pick it up more from the society at large, and those that are around us, than from our parents as a whole

- Social Learning Theory
    - this is the bobo doll version of gender development
    - basically you watch others to see what gets rewarded and what gets punished
    - by the way boys and girls are punished and rewarded due to their gender, one can learn from that observation and imitation of models, and can develop this gender type behaviour
    - parents are implicated somewhat under the assumption that they would be the primary models, but it is suggested that one can observe this behaviour from a wide array of people

- Gender Schema Theory
    - argues that from the beginning you have a cultural learning of gender which gives you a gender schema, a way of looking at the self in the world through the gender lens
    - think of self as male or female, and the culture tells you what that is supposed to be
    - gender organized thinking, and gender-typed behaviour model explains why boys and girls tend to have same sex friends
    - both the social earning theory and the gender schema theory probably occur and work together to produce this gender behaviour

# <a name="6"></a>Lecture 06: Cognitive Psychology I

## <a name="6a"></a>Cognitive Psychology I - Memory: The Big Picture

- Memory as information processing
    - stages and events of memory
- Effortful memory
    - when we are trying to learn and remember
- Memory without awareness
    - when we remember things we do not realize we remember
- The fragility of memory
    - our memories are often a distorted view of reality

## <a name="6b"></a>Stages of Memory

![sensory](imgs/6b_sensory.jpg)
- The different timings of memory
    - **External events**
        - **Sensory input**: Sensory memory registers incoming information, allowing your brain to capture for a fleeting moment a sea of faces.
    - **Sensory memory**: the immediate, initial recording of sensory information in the memory system
        - **Attention to important or novel information**: We pay attention to and encode important or novel stimuli - in this case an angry face in the crowd; or we can say, sensory memory encode to short-term memory.
    - **Short-term memory**: activated memory that holds a few items briefly, such as the seven digits of a phone number while dialing, before the information is stored or forgotten
        - **Encoding**: If we stare at the face long enough (rehearsal), or if we're sufficiently disturbed by it (it's deemed "important"), we will encode it for long-term storage, and we will, an hour later, be able to call up an image of the face.
        - **Retrieval**: When we back long-term memory out to short-term memory
    - **Long-term memory**: the relatively permanent and limitless storehouse of the memory system.

- Think of it in terms of the process that occurs in making memory happen
    - process of encoding, storage and retrieval
    - we can have problems when we don't remember things:
        - the information may **not have been encoded properly**
        - could have trouble remembering information if it has gotten **lost in storage**
        - can **have trouble retrieving the information**

## <a name="6c"></a>Effortful Memory

### <a name="6c1"></a>How much do we retain?

![retainshortterm](imgs/6c1_retainshortterm.jpg)
- How long do you retain information in short-term memory?
    - remember these three letters but while you are doing that, count backwards from 100
    - short-term memory is limited not only in terms of the length, but also in how much we can hold there
    - the basic rule is the short term memory can only hold seven plus or minus two objects
    - this rule was discovered by Bell labs, the telephone company

![retainlongterm](imgs/6c1_retainlongterm.jpg)
- How long do you retain information in long-term memory?
    - we forget much of what we learn
        - note that this is recall, not recognition

![relearn](imgs/6c1_relearn.jpg)
- We can relearn information fairly quickly from Ebbinghaus' Retention Curve above (or called Relearning Curve)
    - as rehearsal increases, relearning time decreases
    - suggests that the information is being retained somewhere, and should be available for later use
    - repetition does seem to aid memory

### <a name="6c2"></a>Cues that Influence Memory

- Ebbinghaus' basic ideas can be dramatically influenced by cues
- there are all kinds of different cues that can influence memory

- Semantic cues are helpful for memory
    - These semantic cues greatly improved the memory for whichever diagram the subjects were given the semantic cue for.

![encodingtype](imgs/6c2_encodingtype.jpg)

- Type of encoding
    - **Semantic**: the meaning, type of...
    - **Acoustic**: rhymes with...
    - **Visual**: written in capitals...
    - Seems like sematic are best

- Cues related to the self-concept are even better
    - the best cues for memory are those that can be processed by, and are relevant to, the individual
    - if you understand how it matters to you, you will remember it better
    - **Self-reference effect**: seeing how something refers to the self helps one to remember it better than anything else could
    - self-centredness to memory

- Context effects
    - other cues can happen through the environment, or situation, that you are in

- State dependent memory
    - we are better at remembering things if we are in the same state we were in when the information was learnt
    - alcohol and memory studies

- Mood
    - we tend to remember things that are consistent with the mood that we are in
    - those who are depressed tend to remember only the sad things that they have dealt with in their lives
    - this is not a very good prescription for getting out of the depressive state that they are in

![scuba](imgs/6c2_scuba.jpg)
- The Scuba Divers Study
    - Learn/remember of words in water/on land
    - showed that: greater recall **when learning and testing contexts are the same**

### <a name="6c3"></a>Interference in Memory

- there is interference that occurs between the new that we are learning and the old information that we already know
- learning one language can actually facilitate learning another, but it can also cause interference

![proretro](imgs/6c3_proretro.jpg)

- **Proactive interference**: happens when what you have learnt previously screws up what you are trying to learn now
- **Retroactive interference**: what you know learn screws up what you used to know

### <a name="6c4"></a>Strategies to Improve Memory

- Mnemonics
    - _sayings or patterns that can be developed to help to remember things_
    - mnemonics will only assist in remembering lists of items, not their meanings
    - musical scales - every good boy does fine
    - OCEAN - Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
    - often just knowing a list of things is not useful

- Chunking
    - _groups items together into different groups_
    - particularly helpful for short-term memory, in that it allows you to keep more information
    - chunking also allows for a smaller number of things to remember at one time

- So that's it for effortful memory
    - we know that our memories are not as good as most of us would like
    - we know that our memory is sensitive to lots of different cues
    - we know that the more we learn, the more we can get confused with knowledge we have already retained
    - we know that there are various strategies that can help improve memory

## <a name="6d"></a>Memory without Awareness

- we can be influenced by a number of things outside our awareness that can affect our memory
- **Priming** - audio taken from in class demonstration: remember words including "ocean", "sand", "moon", when request to prompt a brand of detergent, most people come up with "Tide"
- very subtly priming the concept without the subject realizing that it is influencing them
- this is very closely related to the of memory without awareness

- Study of amnesiacs
    - there are many different types of amnesia
    - head injuries can cause an individual to forget what happened shortly before the accident as a result of the jarring of the brain
    - persons who have epileptic seizures will experience a period of time in which they don't remember
    - what is different about amnesiacs is that they have suffered brain damage so they can never remember anything that happens in the future because it does not make it into their long-term memory

- Study of amnesiacs
    - University of Toronto - Dan Schacter and the story of the golfer
    - someone who play golf really well but can't remember he has play golf before
    - **Procedural memory**
        - able to do something even though the individual is not aware that they can do it
        - see a difference between what they hold in consciousness, what they are able to consciously know about, and what they are able to do

- Despite having no knowledge people can learn various tasks
    - through various tasks developed by cognitive psychologists, it can be shown that people can learn even though they are not aware that they have
    - Study at McMaster University - the famous name study
        - Week 1 - the subjects were given a list of names to learn
        - Week 2 - pick out from the list of names all the people who were famous
        - Result - picked out the names from the list from week 1 as the famous people
        - basic task shows that the group has learned something, but that they are not aware that they have learned something
    - Another way of doing this:
        - Week 1 - give subjects a long list of words to learn
        - Week 2 - give them word stems, and have them complete the first three letters with whatever comes to mind
        - Result - complete the word stem with the words that they learned in week 1

- Learning without awareness is something that happens to all of us
    - affects all of us and guides much of our behaviour even though we have never been consciously aware that we have learned it

## <a name="6e"></a>The Fragility of Memory

- Memory Construction - The Construction of Automobile Destruction (Elizabeth Loftus)
    - showed subjects automobile accidents and asked them how fast the automobiles were going when the made contact with each other, or when they crashed into each other
    - Results - 30 kph for bump, 45 kph for crash
    - study is important for many reasons, one of which is trials
    - the whole legal system is based on the supposition that eyewitnesses know What really happened

- We tend to remember what we want to remember
    - Study on the Study Skills course at U of Waterloo
        - what people remember is how much they have learned and how much their studying has improved
        - what is really true is that they exaggerate how bad they were before they started
        - we often paint ourselves in a positive light in our memory, and as we project for the future

- We remember what we want to remember. Do we also forget what we want to forget?
    - it is not so easy to forget What we want to forget
    - the more thoughts are surpressed, the more often they back into mind
    - post-traumatic stress disorder
    - although memories can be constructed very well, it is more difficult to control or block things out

- Recovered memories
    - Psychodynamic orientation - repressed memories from traumatic events in childhood
    - others believe that memories from childhood are just constructions
    - when people recover memories later on in life it can often be a result of hypnosis, guided imagery and other techniques
    - the question is whether these are false memories or are they a memory of what really happened
    - memories can be constructed through the retelling of stories from our childhood by others

- Cautions
    - research has been able to show that some memories that children have could be constructions of things that never happened
    - it is a lot easier to show that something is false than to show that something is true
    - Some of the things that lead to inaccuracy
        - younger children have less accurate memories
        - memories that occurred under hypnosis or guided imagery are less likely to be accurate
        - as are certain drugs like sodium pentathol
    - Other memories are more likely to be accurate
        - memories that people have always had some recollection of
    - research also suggests that in these cases it is very important to do more investigative work
    - dramatic demonstration of the fragility of our memories
